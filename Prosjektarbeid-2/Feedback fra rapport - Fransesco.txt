At the start: Structure of game, visualize the consept, in-game pictures

List and figures to get more magnet of the contents

- Some of the requirements are blurry, so have to think about (fikk ikke med hvilken han snakket om her, men Leif fikk med seg det)
	

- Cut some of the details 

- Some of the details are not needed, imagine the examiner will have a limited time to read the report,
you have to capture his attention, not get him to be lost, you explain things that are not critical for your
project. Example: "we met the customer every thursdays, but in the beginning it was on mondays", FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT
IF SHORTER, OK, NOT NEED TO FILL UP 50 PAGES.

- In the description of game play, CUT SOME HERE. You show game to examiner before report, so can assume he knows the game before!

- What we don't want is a section where we report the defintion consepts
	- What is useful is how you implement this consept in the project. Map it to our project. 

- On page 15. / page 16 i would drop it completely, what's the 

- Here and there, include code snippets (3-4 lines) examples of unit tests.

- Include some of the parts in the whole rapport, don't break reading flow. 
	And for rest of user stories, go in appendix if want to see more...

- Dark patterns. You included the schema at the end of some of them.. But if you include some of the end, include simple facebook dialog scheme to prove the point.
	The picture is very powerful, its familiar with the facebook dialog and easy to explain.
		This goes for other concepts

- If need more space, cut out the part where you describe the game dynamics. ____Espacilliay if you show the game DEMO to the examiner!!!!___

- Show a bit of code of
